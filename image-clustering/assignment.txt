In the first part, we where asked to create one method that converts a given image to a fully connected undirected graph (Image2Graph)
and return the affinity matrix of that graph.
Then, we were asked to create a function that contains the spectral clustering algorithm.
In demo1 and demo2 scrips, I test my functions, segmenting some given images to 2,3 and 4 clusters, and show the results.
In the second part, I create another function, myNCuts, that solves the clustering problem using the normalized Cuts or n Cuts algorithm.
I test my function in demo3a script clustering two given images to 2,3 and 4 clusters.
Finally, we had to create a recursive version of myNCuts, myRecursiveNCuts, and test it in the last two demos, demo3b and demo3c.
In demo3b I test it for only one iteration, so I use the vanilla myNCuts. However, in the last script I use the recursive one.
To accomplish the recursive version I also had to create the calculateNcuts method, in order to calculate the n-cuts value of the
normalized cuts algorithm and use it as a threshold to stop the recursion inside my function.
